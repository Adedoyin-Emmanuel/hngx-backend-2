# HNGX Backend Task 2 üöÄ

[_See API Documentation_](./DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Objective üéØ

Objective: Build a simple **REST API** capable of **CRUD** operations on a resource, say, a "person". The chosen programming language should interface with any chosen database of your choice.

I'm to build a simple **REST API** capable of **CRUD** operations on a "**person**" resource, interfacing with any database of your choice. Your **API** should dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. Accompany the development with UML diagrams to represent your system's design and database structure. Create an automated testing script that verifies each of your API's operations. Host your entire project on GitHub, and provide well-structured documentation in the repository that outlines request/response formats, setup instructions, and sample API usage.

## Requirements üìö

1. **REST API** Development:
   Develop an API with endpoints for creating a new person.
   **READ**: Fetching details of a person.
   **UPDATE**: Modifying details of an existing person
   **DELETE**: Removing a person.
   Ensure all interactions with the database are secure and free from common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injections).

2. Database Modelling: (Bonus)
   **UML Diagram**: Design and present a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that represents the structure and relationships of your API's classes and models.

3. Testing:
   Develop a script (e.g., using tools like Postman or scripts written in Python using the requests library) that automates the testing of each **CRUD** operation in your API.
   This should:
   Add a new person (e.g., "Mark Essien").
   Fetch details of a person
   Modify the details of an existing person.
   Remove a person

4. Dynamic Parameter Handling:
   Your API should be flexible enough to handle dynamic input. If we provide a name (or other details), your backend should be able to process operations using that name.
   Example: If we pass "Mark Essien", we should be able to perform all CRUD operations on "Mark Essien".
   Add validation ‚Äì field should only be strings; integers or any other data type should not be allowed.

5. GitHub Repository:
   Create a GitHub repository for this project.
   Ensure the repository contains:
   A detailed README.md file explaining how to set up, run, and use the API.
   The source code for the API.
   UML diagrams (or links to view them).

6. Documentation:
   Provide a documentation file (e.g., DOCUMENTATION.md in your GitHub repo) that outlines:
   Standard formats for requests and responses for each endpoint.
   Sample usage of the API, including example requests and expected responses.
   Any known limitations or assumptions made during development.
   Instructions for setting up and deploying the API locally or on a server.
   Hosting Use the same Server used in the Stage One task (or another server, if possible), and modify it accordingly to host your endpoint with a URL like this <https://theirdomain.com/api>
   Test extensively with various testing tools to make sure it is accessible before submitting

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úçÔ∏è

Functional REST API: The API should successfully perform all CRUD operations.
Modeling Diagrams: Clear and accurate UML and E-R diagrams should be provided.
Effective Testing Script: The script should successfully test all the CRUD operations without manual intervention.
Dynamic Parameter Handling: The API should correctly handle and respond to different parameters provided.
GitHub Repository: Repository should be well-organized, contain all necessary files, and be publicly accessible.
Detailed Documentation: Documentation should provide clear guidance on how to use the API, including setup, request/response formats, and sample usage.
